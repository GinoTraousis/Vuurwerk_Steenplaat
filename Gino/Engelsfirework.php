<p>          <h1>Yes/no firework?</h1>

<h3>Prohibition</h3>
Yes or no firework? That is the question of many people in this country. Each year you hear there is trouble with firework, Only is it in the recent years a lot more: firework that is throwing to policecars, More and more firework are causing destruction but the biggest trouble is that its causing nuisance. 
<br> 
<br>
<h3>Environment</h3>
There is also been problems with nitrogen and fireworks only making it even worse then. By throwing firework comes chemical fabrics and heavy metal in the air, bottom and groundwater. On new years eve is it in the city 30 times worse.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Safety</h3>
Nearly 500 people ended up injured every year during the newyear, an average of one death per year and around 11.000 incidents are registered. Its in the Netherland the most unsafe party of the year.  
<br>
<br>
<h3>My opinion</h3>
My opinion is that firework should be forbidden. Its causing nuisance for people and the animals. For the animal its the worst thing because they dont know what is happening . Safety is of course one of the reasons why I think it should be forbidden. And the nitrogen is already a big problem with cars, firework is only making it worse more and more.
